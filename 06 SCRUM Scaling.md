# SCRUM Scaling

When it comes multiple SCRUM teams, the `SCRUM Guide` provides a framework called `Nexus`. For multiple SCRUM Teams, the most fundamental concept is

- There should be only one Product
- There should be only one Product Backlog
- There should be only one Product Owner

We need to follow

- For multiple team, there can be a single `SCRUM Master` or each team can have their own `SCRUM Master`.
- Here the core concern can be, reduce the dependency between teams and increase the velocity. 
- Sprint duration, start and end date should be the same.
- Except the product owner, one person can play different roles
