## Team Introduction

Let's consider a company, used to sell their product through the super market. Now they want to set up a e-commerce solution, where they wan to sell the product directly to the consumer.

So they hire a team, along with a `scrum-master`, programmer, engineer, tester and marketing persons.

### Agile Manifesto

The values and ideas of `Agile Manifesto` is derived from couple of broader range of frameworks, like

- SCRUM
- KANBAN
- CRYSTAL
- EXTREME PROGRAMMING

`Agile Manifesto` uncovering better ways of developing software by

- Doing it
- Helping others do it

`Agile Manifesto` values,

- Both `Individuals` and `Interactions` over processes and tools. This implies that, `skilled` and `committed` people working together toward a common goal.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation. This implies, primary focus is to build a working product
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation. This implies, between customer and producer, we do not want only the contract and the lawyers. We want,
  - Building a trust
  - A workable relationship
  - Shared goal
- Responding to change over following a plan. This brings the adaption and flexibility.

> Although the Agile manifesto ideas are almost 20 years old, It not only applicable to the software development but other categories of products.

### History

- SCRUM used to use to the product development papers since 1986
- Ken Schwaber and James Sutherland publish scrum framework 1995
- Agile Manifesto was was first written back on 2001

### SCRUM

SCRUM is a framework for dealing complex product. Now-a-days, constant market condition changing and technological improvements, gives us higher level of uncertainty. With this uncertainty, it is impossible to predict how a product should be developed. In simpler term, we can not predict future and absolutely have no clue what can be customer requirements six months later after the product being developed. Spent six months to plan for a product and spent another 2 years to develop the product does not work anymore.

So to create a product with market value, we have to work with time box and adapt with new changes.

With these requirements, SCRUM provides,

✅ Time boxes
✅ Feedback loops
✅ Dealing with uncertainty

### Sprint

A Sprint combines combines all the aspects of work, required to build a product. This provide output of working, tested and potentially shippable product, even though it might not be delivered to the end users.

After a `sprint`, the team demonstrate what they have accomplished and what to do next. This short iterations allow constant feedback and considerably increase the probability of creating right product.

**SCRUM Team**

A SCRUM team consists of

- SCRUM Master
- Product Owner
- Developers

**Product Owner :** Created the list of features called, `Product Backlog`. This backlog list is organized in such a way, so the customer can get maximum value.

**Sprint Planning :** During the spring planning, the developers will select top items from the backlog list. A sprint can not be longer than one month. The team do a collaboration daily called `SCRUM Meeting`. `SCRUM Meeting` is responsible for synchronize, identify problem and move forward.

At the end of the `SCRUM`, the product should be potentially shippable. The `SCRUM Team` along with the stakeholders, conduct a review on what is completed and what to do next.

The last event of the `Sprint` is to do the `Retrospective`. It involves, how the spring went and figured out improving development process.

Then the team plan for next sprint and cycle begin again.
