# SCRUM Theory

## SCRUM

`SCRUM` is 

- Lightweight Process framework
- Use to manage complex work
- Simple to understand

`SCRUM` is not a process, technique or definitive framework.

## Theory

- SCRUM is built on `Empiricism`, knowledge, that comes from experience
- This `Empirical` process has 3 pillars,
  - Transparency
    - Observers should have common understanding
  - Inspection
    - Regular check the 3 `SCRUM Artifacts`
      - Product Backlog
      - Sprint Backlog
      - Increment
  - Adaptation
    - To obtain the expected result, necessary adjustment must be done
    - To do so, SCRUM describes 4 events
      - Sprint Planning
      - Daily SCRUM
      - Sprint Review
      - Sprint Retrospective
- A SCRUM team should build on the following values
  - Commitment
