A `SCRUM Team` consists of

- Product Owner
- SCRUM Master
- Development Team

The team has to be

- **Self Organizing**: Choose themselves to guide themselves other than directed by others.
- **Cross Functional**: Has the ability to resolve all the issues and reach the goal.

The team optimize

- Flexibility
- Creativity
- Productivity

## Product Owner

`Product Owner` is responsible to maximize the product value. This product value can come from

- **Business Value**: More revenue
- **Customer Value**: More customer satisfiction
- **Technical Value**: The dev team reaching goal more quickly

The `Product Owner` is a single person, can not be a committee. At the end the `Product Owner` is the one solely responsible for the product outcome, so each and everyone should respect the `Product Owner` decision. To change the `Product Backlog`, `Product Owner` is the one should consult with.

`Product Owner` reflect the expected outcome in the `Product Backlog` of the stakeholders and other customer, also responsible to make the `Product Backlog` transparent to the development team.

## Development Team

Dev Team is the team of professionals. This dev team is the one responsible for meeting the `Sprint Goal`. If a team member is absent, it should not be an excuse of not meeting the `Sprint Goal`.

The `Dev Team` has to be `self-organizing`, no one will direct the approach or way, how this should be done. Instead, it is developers responsibility to find the approach and process to meet the goal.

The team has to be `cross-functional`, the team should have all the skills to meet the goal.

Overall it is solely the `Dev Team` responsibility to increment the product value at the end of the `Sprint`.

It can be possible but not encouraged, the `Product Owner` and the `SCRUM Master` will be the part of the `Dev Team`.

## SCRUM Master

`SCRUM Master` helps the `Product Owner` and the `SCRUM Team` to understand the `SCRUM` theory, terms and roles. `SCRUM Master` acts as `SCRUM Coach` for the organization.

In a SCRUM Team, the `SCRUM Master` put everyone before himself and make sure the team is familiar with the process and convention.
