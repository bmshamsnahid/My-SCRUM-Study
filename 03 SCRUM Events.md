# SCRUM Events

`Sprint` is the heart of the `SCRUM` and the `Sprint` is the container of all the SCRUM events. `SCRUM Event` is mandatory and SCRUM team can not simply decide to skip the events. To reduce the complexity, the `SCRUM Events` should happen same time and place.

The `Sprint` contains the following `SCRUM Events`

- Spring Planning
- Daily SCRUM
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective

All these events,

- Are included inside a time frame
- Provide the `Transparency` and `Inspection`

The SCRUM team is not only bound by the events, the team can held other meetings whenever necessary. For example, the `Product Backlog Refinement` meeting is not included into the `SCRUM Events`.

### Time Box

---

`Time Box` force to focus on the most import tasks.

For `SCRUM Event` time box is very strict frame. For a `Sprint` like 1 month, the maximum time for `Sprint Planning` event is 8 hours or less. It can not exceed the 8 hours time frame.

Except the `Sprint` itself, time frame can be closed earlier. For `Sprint`, even though the `Sprint Backlog Item` closed earlier, the `Sprint` does not close before the `Sprint` time frame.

For example, for a tour, we may take half of the day for do the packing. `Sprint Time Box` suggest to do it in compact time frame, for example in 1 hour. It is possible we might forget to pack the tooth-brash. We buy the tooth-brash from somewhere, but it saves from bigger risk, miss the flight.

### The Sprint

---

Typically a `Sprint` length is one month or less. The naming can be confused with `Sprint Race`, by putt all the energy in a `Sprint`. But in `SCRUM Sprint`, the development work must be performed in a sustainable peace, `Sprint` after `Sprint`.

Instead of planning for a year, to reduce the complexity, risk and adaptation, its better to plan a short period and re-evaluated time to time.

Sprint allows the `Product Backlog Refinement` activity and other relevant meetings.

During a `Sprint`, the `Sprint Scope` can be clarified and re-negotiated, without

- Making any changes that may endanger the `Sprint Goal`
- Decrease the `Quality Standards`

Duration of the `Sprint` should not be changed during or after `Sprint`. The `Sprint Scopes` that does not meet the `Definition of Done`, must be go back to the `Product Backlog`.

### Sprint Planning

---

It is the first event of the `Sprint`, best to held same time and place. For a `Sprint` that length is 1 month, the `Sprint Planning` should be 8 hours long. For the smaller length of `Sprint`, the `Sprint Planning` time should be less.

It is not necessary to happen the `Sprint Retrospective` and `Sprint Planning` happening in the same day. The `Spring Retrospective` belongs to the previous `Sprint` and the `Sprint Planning` belongs to the current `Sprint`.

It is important to consider, the `Sprint` should never be delayed in any circumstance.

The `Spring Planning` describe

- WHY the Sprint is valuable
- WHAT needs to be done during the Sprint
- HOW the work will be done
