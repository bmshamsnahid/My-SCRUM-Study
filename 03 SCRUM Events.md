# SCRUM Events

`Sprint` is the heart of the `SCRUM` and the `Sprint` is the container of all the SCRUM events. `SCRUM Event` is mandatory and SCRUM team can not simply decide to skip the events. To reduce the complexity, the `SCRUM Events` should happen same time and place.

The `Sprint` contains the following `SCRUM Events`

- Spring Planning
- Daily SCRUM
- Sprint Review
- Sprint Retrospective

All these events,

- Are included inside a time frame
- Provide the `Transparency` and `Inspection`

The SCRUM team is not only bound by the events, the team can held other meetings whenever necessary. For example, the `Product Backlog Refinement` meeting is not included into the `SCRUM Events`.

### Time Box

---

`Time Box` force to focus on the most import tasks.

For `SCRUM Event` time box is very strict frame. For a `Sprint` like 1 month, the maximum time for `Sprint Planning` event is 8 hours or less. It can not exceed the 8 hours time frame.

Except the `Sprint` itself, time frame can be closed earlier. For `Sprint`, even though the `Sprint Backlog Item` closed earlier, the `Sprint` does not close before the `Sprint` time frame.

For example, for a tour, we may take half of the day for do the packing. `Sprint Time Box` suggest to do it in compact time frame, for example in 1 hour. It is possible we might forget to pack the tooth-brash. We buy the tooth-brash from somewhere, but it saves from bigger risk, miss the flight.

### The Sprint

---

Typically a `Sprint` length is one month or less. The naming can be confused with `Sprint Race`, by putt all the energy in a `Sprint`. But in `SCRUM Sprint`, the development work must be performed in a sustainable peace, `Sprint` after `Sprint`.

Instead of planning for a year, to reduce the complexity, risk and adaptation, its better to plan a short period and re-evaluated time to time.

Sprint allows the `Product Backlog Refinement` activity and other relevant meetings.

During a `Sprint`, the `Sprint Scope` can be clarified and re-negotiated, without

- Making any changes that may endanger the `Sprint Goal`
- Decrease the `Quality Standards`

Duration of the `Sprint` should not be changed during or after `Sprint`. The `Sprint Scopes` that does not meet the `Definition of Done`, must be go back to the `Product Backlog`.

### Sprint Planning

---

It is the first event of the `Sprint`, best to held same time and place. For a `Sprint` that length is 1 month, the `Sprint Planning` should be 8 hours long. For the smaller length of `Sprint`, the `Sprint Planning` time should be less.

It is not necessary to happen the `Sprint Retrospective` and `Sprint Planning` happening in the same day. The `Spring Retrospective` belongs to the previous `Sprint` and the `Sprint Planning` belongs to the current `Sprint`.

It is important to consider, the `Sprint` should never be delayed in any circumstance.

The `Spring Planning` describe

- WHY the Sprint is valuable

  > The `Sprint Goal` is towards the `Product Goal`, decided by the whole `SCRUM Team`. The `Sprint Goal` should be

  - Specific
  - Measurable
  - Flexible

    `Sprint Backlog` is taken from the top list of the `Product Backlog`.

- WHAT needs to be done during the Sprint

  > Sprint forecast the Sprint Goal. This show the potentially completed value, that will be gained after the Sprint is being completed.

  How much value can be added, can be determined by,

  - Past performance velocity
  - Capacity of the Sprint (Length)
  - Definition of Done (Improve Quality)

  > The important concept in `Sprint Planning` is `Hands Off`. Here developer take/pull the backlog according to the previous history, velocity and quality. No one give/provide assign the backlog to the developers.

- HOW the work will be done
  - Developers responsibility: It is developer teams responsibility to make the Sprint Backlog meet the Definition of Done
  - Decomposition of Work: If a Product Backlog is too big or complex, developers can make them smaller pieces called task.
  - Too Much or To Little: If the Sprint has too much backlog or less backlog than expected, the team can seat with the Product owner and sort it out.

### Daily SCRUM

---

It's a max 15 minutes meeting, happen daily, in the same time and places. The goal for the `Daily SCRUM` is `Inspection and Adaption`. It could be a discussion of

- What did I did yesterday
- What is today plan
- Is there any blocker issue

Even though this is an internal meeting, the developer team can allow others to be present. It is `SCRUM Master` responsibility to make sure, they do not disturbed the meeting.

> This is a meeting of the developer, no to reporting the progress to the `Product Owner` or `Steak Holders`

It helps

- Identify problem
- Find out a quick decision

### Sprint Review

---

At the end of the Sprint, the developers should provide a potentially shippable product. It there is any `Sprint Backlog` not done during the Sprit, it will go to `Product Backlog`. The `Spring Review` meeting is hold by the `Product Owner` and SCRUM team and stakeholders are also invited. This meeting length can be 4 hours for a 1 month long Sprint.

In meeting, it is shown, what is done and not done. Even sometimes a live demon is also shown to the `Stakeholders`.

The developer team explains, what went well, what was the blocking issue and how the issue being solved.

The stakeholders provide feedback on done part and marker analysis. The product backlog can be refined on these feedback.

The product owner explain, what can be expected on the next sprint.

### Sprint Retrospective

---

`Sprint Retrospective` is the last event of `Sprint`. We inspect and adapt the process through `Sprint Retrospective`. This meeting is limited to the `SCRUM Team`. Typically for a 1 month `Sprint` the meeting length is around 3 hours or less. `SCRUM Team` can change or strict the `Definition of Done` here. `Sprint Backlog` can be added for the next `Sprint`.

### Sprint Cancellation

---

Cancellation is a very rare event and only the `Product Owner` can call this.

For a cancelled Sprint, the completed `Sprint Backlog` will be reviewed and the incomplete `Sprint Backlog` will go to `Product Backlog` section.
