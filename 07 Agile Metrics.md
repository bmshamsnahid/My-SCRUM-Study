# Agile Metrics

## Velocity

Amount of work a dev team done during a typical sprint.

Velocity can be calculated,

```
velocity = (Work sprint 1 + Work sprint 1 +  + ... + Work sprint N) / number of sprints
```

Using `velocity`, SCRUM team can decide how much work can be done towards the next sprint.

> `Velocity` can not be used as `Value` for the product owner.

## Burn-down Charts

A graphical representation of work. It is only related to the remaining work. 

It **does not** relate,

- Project cost or any business value
- Productivity of the dev team

It is a chart of `story-points vs remaining-time-of-sprint`. The chart contains two line,

- Ideal linear progress, grey line
- Remaining work, red line

The teams target is make the red line reach to the vertical line.

## Burn-up Charts

Graphical representation of the completed work. It is opposite of the `Burn Down Chart`, show how much work is being done.

## Cone of Uncertainty

It typically happen in the software development. Initially, the less is known in the project, the uncertainty is high. The more we know over time of the project, the uncertainty get less.
