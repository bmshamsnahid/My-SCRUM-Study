## Artifacts

### Overview

---

According to the Scrum Guide, there are 3 artifacts,

1. Product Backlog
2. Sprint Backlog
3. Increment, aka Product Increment

Artifacts in SCRUM represents, `Work` or `Value`.

With `Artifacts`, SCRUM provides,

- Transparency
- Inspection
- Adaptation

SCRUM uses many terms, we do not use in our day to day conversation.

Each of the 3 SCRUM `Artifacts` has commitment towards something.

- `Product Backlog` exists to provide a long term objective, the `Product Goal`
- `Spring Backlog` exists to provide the `Spring Goal`
- `Increment` is committed to fulfill the `Definition of Done`, means the desired quality a product should have

Here the `Commitment` stands for

- Dedication to achieve the goal
- Why the work is important
- What is the desired outcome

### Product Backlog

---

A product is something that customers use and get benefited. It could be a computer, vaccine or even a space-ship.

With computer customer can do calculation, with vaccine people make antibody and with space-ship, it is possible to travel space.

With SCRUM terminology these output or benefits from product is called the value.

Backlog stands for list of unfinished work.

For example, if we plan for a tour, we have a list

- Finalize the destination
- Book hotels
- Buy tickets
- Take leaves, etc

Before tour, none of the items are done, and the are the backlog.

Now we can not book tickets before the leave is confirmed. It's a risk. It will be a collision if we book tickets and can not take the leaves.

Again, we can not buy ticket or book hotel before select the destination.

So the order should be,

- Take leaves
- Select destination
- Buy Tickets
- Book Hotels

Now, let's say, for tour destination and tour planning, we want to relay on a travel group. The tour group has multiple locations and plan for the tour. Here comes the **Transparency**. The tour group needs to know, you want a relax tour or adventure one. You prefer the sea or the mountain.

With these preference criteria, it is helpful for the tour group to provide a very good package.

The process of looking and observing all the plans aka `Backlog` is called **Inspection**.

With **Adaptation**, if we see something is wrong, missing or unclear we can change it.

With the **Inspection** and **Adaptation** SCRUM is continuously improved and it is called **Refinement**. This can be done by Q/A and adding things thats need to be done.

A product backlog item can be,

- Features
- Improvement
- Fixing

Each product backlog item can contain,

- Description
- Order
- Size
- Value
- Acceptance Criteria

Product owner is the responsible person for product backlog.

Product backlog is created on the objective of how the product should achieve. The product owner collaborate with the stakeholders to understand the business requirement, analysis the markets. There should be only one product goal at a time.

Adding product backlog is an ongoing process. The product owner is responsible for add, update or remove product backlog any time wants. This make the product owner work closely with the developers. With product refinement, the product owner help the developers to break down the backlog into smaller task with details, size and order.

**Sizing** is the estimation, developer is responsible of.

To reduce complexity, often the product owner and developer make the tradeoffs. And this is not the part of the SCRUM. The SCRUM team decides when and how the refinement should happen.

This is why the product backlog is never completed and always changing.

The top backlog items should be

- Fit for the sprint
- Immediately actionable
- SCRUM team agree to make it done

### Real World Example: Product Goal and Product Backlog

Let's say we want to make a tour app that will display the events off upcoming tours of various tour group.

First the `Product Owner` define the goal and create the backlog.

**Product Goal:** Help 1000 tourist to find their next team.

**Product Backlog:**

- List of upcoming events
- List of tour groups
- Gather all the tour groups information available out there
  - Facebook page
  - Facebook group
  - Corresponding persons
- Easy Search and filter functionality of
  - Groups
  - Events
    - By group
    - By place
    - By area
    - By budget
- Continuously gather all the events
  - Place
  - Group
  - Page
  - Budget
  - Date

### User Stories

When the product owner added the product backlog, it do not mean a lot. To make sense, the product owner work closely with the developers and put necessary details.

From product backlog, the `Product Owner`, `SCRUM Master` and `Developers` generate the `Backlog Item` with

- Description
- Order
- Size
- Value
- Acceptance Criteria

The SCRUM guide itself, does not provide any template or recommendation, how a `Backlog Item` should be. It is very common to use the `User Stories` as `Backlog Item`. It is so common, the `Backlog Item` itself often refer as the `User Stories`.

In `User Stories`, commonly we put a short description, from a product user perspective, who desired the functionality.

While writing a users stories, we go though a 3 step process, also known as 3 C's,

- Card
- Conversation
- Confirmation

**Card:** In the card, we usually refer a stories as followings

> As a **< USER ROLE >**, I want **< SOME OBJECTIVE >**, so that **< SOME OUTCOME >**.

Here the

- `User Role` is the `WHO`
- `Some Objective` is the `WHAT`
- `Some Outcome` or benefit is the `WHY`

**Conversation:** It's like reminder what need to done. It should be brief to the point.

**Confirmation:** This determine the acceptance criteria.It's a way to test if the story is being completed.

The story does not always have to be the 3 C's. It should be decided by the SCRUM team which format works best. Ans yes, it is okay to use different story format in single project.

Even `User Stories` are not a mandatory part of the SCRUM.

### Real World Example: User Stories

We had a product backlog

> List of upcoming events

We can transform this as a User stories as followings

Story: As a customer, I want to see the list of upcoming tour events, so I can choose one and contact.

Description: The is the core feature. For each tour group, there should be list of events be entry into system. The customer will come and select one from them.

Acceptance Criteria:

- In the app, there should be list of events

### Planning Poker

Humans mind is more trained in comparing rather than measuring. With this context, In SCRUM for backlog items, instead of estimation, we are using the sizing terms.

For example, let's consider climbing a mountain. If this is a small hill, we consider the size 0 and for Everest it will be 100.

Each developer will put a number between 1 to 100 for a backlog item. Then will be a brief discussion specially the highest and lowest scoring. This points the complexity and possibly the effective solution.

The initial sizing may have big difference between developes, but with brief discussion and repeat the precess, it is possible to come up a fixed sizing.

Even with the discussion, we can reduce or change some objectives of the backlog, as long as the SPRINT Goal and the Product Goal is consistent.

This method is referred as `Planning Poker`.

### Adding Value To Product Backlog

Along with the developers put the backlog estimation, the product owner need to put the backlog value as well. SCRUM mandates, each product backlog should have a value. I can be done by creating a simple value scale. In the scale, you can add multiple values starting from 100 to 1000. When we have different product backlog items, we can arranged them base on perceived values on the scale. And using the scale we can assign each product backlog items the value as expected.

### Spring Backlog

---

During the `Spring` planning meeting, the `Product Owner` what needs to be done to increase the product values. By collaborating with the `Product Owner`, the developers will decide, which items of the top list of `Product Backlog`, should be added to the `Spring Backlog`.

The `Sprint Backlog` has a `Sprint Goal` to deliver the `Product Value Increment`.

Since the developers are accountable for the `Sprint Backlog`, even the `Product Owner` can not change the `Sprint Backlog` without collaborating the developers.

Each `Spring Backlog Item` comes from the decomposition of the `Product Backlog Items`.

In a `Sprint`,

- `Sprint Backlog Items` or tasks are `What To Do`
- `Spring Plan` is `How To Do`
- `Spring Goal` is `Why To Do`

Any unfinished work from the `Sprint Backlog` will be goes back to the `Product Backlog`.
