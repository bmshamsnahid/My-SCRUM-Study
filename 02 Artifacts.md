## Artifacts

### Overview

According to the Scrum Guide, there are 3 artifacts,

1. Product Backlog
2. Sprint Backlog
3. Increment, aka Product Increment

Artifacts in SCRUM represents, `Work` or `Value`.

With `Artifacts`, SCRUM provides,

- Transparency
- Inspection
- Adaptation

SCRUM uses many terms, we do not use in our day to day conversation.

Each of the 3 SCRUM `Artifacts` has commitment towards something.

- `Product Backlog` exists to provide a long term objective, the `Product Goal`
- `Spring Backlog` exists to provide the `Spring Goal`
- `Increment` is committed to fulfill the `Definition of Done`, means the desired quality a product should have

Here the `Commitment` stands for

- Dedication to achieve the goal
- Why the work is important
- What is the desired outcome

### Product Backlog

A product is something that customers use and get benefited. It could be a computer, vaccine or even a space-ship.

With computer customer can do calculation, with vaccine people make antibody and with space-ship, it is possible to travel space.

With SCRUM terminology these output or benefits from product is called the value.

Backlog stands for list of unfinished work.

For example, if we plan for a tour, we have a list

- Finalize the destination
- Book hotels
- Buy tickets
- Take leaves, etc

Before tour, none of the items are done, and the are the backlog.

Now we can not book tickets before the leave is confirmed. It's a risk. It will be a collision if we book tickets and can not take the leaves.

Again, we can not buy ticket or book hotel before select the destination.

So the order should be,

- Take leaves
- Select destination
- Buy Tickets
- Book Hotels

Now, let's say, for tour destination and tour planning, we want to relay on a travel group. The tour group has multiple locations and plan for the tour. Here comes the **Transparency**. The tour group needs to know, you want a relax tour or adventure one. You prefer the sea or the mountain.

With these preference criteria, it is helpful for the tour group to provide a very good package.

The process of looking and observing all the plans aka `Backlog` is called **Inspection**.

With **Adaptation**, if we see something is wrong, missing or unclear we can change it.

With the **Inspection** and **Adaptation** SCRUM is continuously improved and it is called **Refinement**. This can be done by Q/A and adding things thats need to be done.

A product backlog item can be,

- Features
- Improvement
- Fixing

Each product backlog item can contain,

- Description
- Order
- Size
- Value
- Acceptance Criteria

Product owner is the responsible person for product backlog.
